### Tech Stacks Used

- React
- Styled Components
- Graphql
- Greensocks

### Approach

As i have mentioned before i have a passion for design so for all my projects, i make sure i work on the design first of how the overall website will look like. I started on the project right after, this was a simple and straighforward project, the challenging part i would say is the animating part, but other than that it was pretty much straightforward.

### What I Learned

What i learned from this project is making the contact form actually send the email to the specified address. For that i used EmailJS.

Also i learned how to animate parts of an SVG which was fun to work with.
